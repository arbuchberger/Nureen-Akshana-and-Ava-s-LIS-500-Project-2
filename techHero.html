      Kande Sill, a 16 year old British girl, has innovated within the medical field through the invention of her
      medical drone that includes an insulated, theft-resistant container, which is overall meant
      to transfer sensitive items, such as blood and vaccines, while minimizing theft. Not only has she invented this at
      such a young age, she is also an author, who has already written three novels under
      the name Kande S. Summers. Some aspects of her books showcase gender empowerment for other women like her who want
      to be successful, and additionally, she has called out the lack of diversity within
      children's publishing. Lastly, due to her drone accomplishment, she has been awarded the prestigious Arkwright
      Engineering Scholarship.
