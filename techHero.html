            <h2>Ava's Tech Hero: Kande Sill</h2>
            <p>
              Kande Sill, a 16 year old British girl, has innovated within the medical field through the invention of her
              medical drone that includes an insulated, theft-resistant container, which is overall meant
              to transfer sensitive items, such as blood and vaccines, while minimizing theft. Not only has she invented this at
              such a young age, she is also an author, who has already written three novels under
              the name Kande S. Summers. Some aspects of her books showcase gender empowerment for other women like her who want
              to be successful, and additionally, she has called out the lack of diversity within
              children's publishing. Lastly, due to her drone accomplishment, she has been awarded the prestigious Arkwright
              Engineering Scholarship.

            <h2>Nureen's Tech Hero: Bobbie Manne</h2>
            <p>
            After attending events at UW last week where Bobbie Manne is the speaker, Nureen has been inspired by her career journey 
            even more. Bobbie Manne is a Senior Fellow at AMD (a world leading semiconductor) who focuses in efficient and sustainable 
            computer architecture. She has been in both industrial research labs and product teams at companies such as AMD, Microsoft, 
            and Intel for decades. Not only that, she has around 30 publications and around 40 patents pending. As a woman of color in 
            male-dominated field and a mother, she proves that she is indeed capable of leading a team and brings tons of values to the 
            team. She is also very good at presenting, and gets her point across the room.

            <h2>Akshana's Tech Hero: Corey Jackson</h2>
            <p>
            Coreyâ€™s research bridges human-centered computing, computer-supported cooperative work, and design epistemologies from fields such as 
            organization studies, psychology, and education. His work employs qualitative and quantitative methodologies and is informed by a 
            socio-technical perspective and theories. His research contributes to the design of open collaboration platforms and is directed by 
            two complementary approaches: (1) documenting human experiences online and (2) implementing and evaluating system affordances.
