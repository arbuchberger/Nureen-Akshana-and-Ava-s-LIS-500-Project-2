            <p>
                “Hi, I’m Ava Buchberger, a senior UW-Madison student who is majoring in information science.
                I chose this particular major because of the wide variety of subjects that I enjoy, such as
                computer science and data science. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, biking, and hanging
                out with friends. Lastly, I hope LIS 500 teaches me the importance of intersectionality within
                tech fields and how we can make positive changes.”

            <p>
                “Hi, I’m Nureen, a junior at UW-Madison double majoring in computer and information science.
                I enjoy working on projects involving network, security, and operating systems. Lately, I've been
                enjoying the intersection of human and tech, which is why I chose to pair my major with InfoSci after my
                second year. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking and travelling. I am an adrenaline junkie and I am
                planning to go skydive. Lastly, I hope I can learn how my background can make influence in the industry
                especially cybersecurity.”
