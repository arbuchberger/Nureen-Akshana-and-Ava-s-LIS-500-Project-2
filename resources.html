    Hello and welcome to the Code and Power Group 2 resources page! Our group strives for equity in the technology industry and promotes the discussion
     of anything and everything related to it. Here you will find links to some amazing articles related to equity with topics
     ranging from the IBT to intersectionality. We hope for a better future, a place where all different types of people are 
     accounted for in their unique expereinces. We also hope that implicit biases are reduced in the industry, that people are 
     more openly aware of sytematic issues, and that the we create a place that everyone is judged only by objective measures.
